**Science Research Achievement: AI, Data, and Technology**

In 2024, I was honored to receive recognition for my research in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data, and Technology** at **HUFIT (Ho Chi Minh City University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology)**. My research focused on the application of new technology algorithms to enhance data analysis processes in real-time systems.
