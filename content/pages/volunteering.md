      Volunteer Vietnam is a non-profit organization dedicated to volunteering
      and community development across the country. I have had the privilege of
      working in an environment that fosters connection and knowledge sharing
      among individuals from various industries and fields at iVolunteer
      Vietnam. Through this communication support campaign, I aim to highlight
      our mission of connecting and sharing development opportunities while
      accompanying all volunteers on their journeys of self-discovery and
      self-positioning. Together, we can empower each other and create a
      positive impact in the communities we serve.
