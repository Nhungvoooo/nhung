          The 5th International Conference on Business (ICB 2023) serves as a
          premier platform for academics, researchers, and industry
          professionals to share insights and advancements in the field of
          business. This year's conference aims to foster collaboration and
          innovation across various disciplines within business studies. The
          adoption of smart contracts based on blockchain technology represents
          a transformative shift in how agreements are executed and enforced
          across various industries. Smart contracts are self-executing
          contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.
          This innovation enhances transparency, security, and efficiency in
          transactions.
